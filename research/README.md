# Research log

Short, durable notes for benchmark runs and parameter sweeps. Each entry should include:

- goal (what are we optimizing for)
- exact command(s) used
- key results (tables + link to HTML report snapshot)
- findings (objective + subjective, in one section)

## Entries

- `2026-02-08-mbpp-oc-sweep-granite4`: MBPP OpenShift sweep (18 configs) for pass rate vs time-to-solve.
- `2026-02-08-mbpp-oc-focused-500-granite4`: MBPP OpenShift focused rerun (`samples=2,3`, `debug=0,1`, `timeout=60`, `limit=500`).

## Entry template

Use this structure for consistency:

1. Goal / scope
2. Environment + commands
3. Key results
4. Findings
