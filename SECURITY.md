# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please open a GitHub issue with minimal details and
we will follow up, or contact the maintainers privately if the repository provides a security
contact.

## Notes

This project executes model-generated code in a Docker sandbox, but that does not guarantee perfect
isolation. Treat generated code as untrusted.
